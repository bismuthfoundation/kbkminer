# kbkminer
GPU CUDA Miner for Bismuth.

### Install instructions (Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Server):
* Install Ubuntu 20.04 **server** on a PC with at least one Nvidia GPU, memory requirement on GPU at least 1075MiB.
* Boot into the new server and do the following
```sudo apt update```
```sudo apt upgrade```
```sudo reboot```
* Write ```apt search nvidia-driver``` and find a suitable driver for your system.
* In this example we choose the following: ```sudo apt install nvidia-headless-470-server``` When finished, reboot
* ```sudo apt install nvidia-utils-470-server``` followed by ```nvidia-smi -q | grep "Product Name"``` Make sure that at least one GPU is detected.
* ```git clone https://github.com/Bismuthfoundation/Bismuth.git``` followed by ```cd Bismuth```
* ```sudo apt install python3-pip``` followed by ```pip3 install -r requirements-node.txt```
* ```screen -mS node python3 node.py``` You need to wait a while for the Junction Noise file to be created and the ledger bootstrapped and synced. While you wait you can press ```Ctrl-A d```to detach from the screen session, and ```screen -r node``` to go back.
* ```cd ~``` ```git clone https://github.com/Bismuthfoundation/Optipoolware.git```
* ```cd Optipoolware``` ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
* ```cp optipoolware.py ../Bismuth``` ```cp pool.txt ../Bismuth```
* ```cd ~/Bismuth``` ```screen -mS pool python3 optipoolware.py``` You can press ```Ctrl-A d```to detach from the pool session, and ```screen -r pool``` to go back.
* ```sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit``` followed by ```nvcc --version``` to check the version. In this example V10.1.243 was used.
* ```cd ~``` ```git clone https://github.com/Bismuthfoundation/kbkminer.git```
* ```sudo apt install cmake``` ```sudo apt install python3-pybind11```
* ```cd kbkminer``` ```chmod u+x mycompile.sh``` ```./mycompile.sh```
* Edit miner.txt to use your own miner_address
* ```cp optihash.py ../Bismuth``` ```cp miner.txt ../Bismuth``` ```cp bis.so ../Bismuth```
* Do not start the miner before the ledger is fully synced. The variable last_block_ago should be less than 300 seconds. Check with ```cd ~/Bismuth``` ```python3 commands.py statusget```
* ```cd ~/Bismuth``` ```screen -mS miner python3 optihash.py``` You can press ```Ctrl-A d```to detach from the miner session, and ```screen -r miner``` to go back.

### Install instructions (Ubuntu 20.04 **Desktop** ISO):
If you want to install kbkminer on the Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop edition, instead of the Server edition, use the following minor modifications instead:
* ```sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470``` followed by ```sudo apt install git```

### Install instructions (Ubuntu 18.04 **Desktop** ISO):
* Install Ubuntu 18.04 desktop on a PC with at least one Nvidia GPU, memory requirement on GPU at least 1075MiB.
* Boot into the new server and do the following ```sudo apt update``` ```sudo apt upgrade``` ```sudo reboot```
* ```sudo apt install build-essential dkms freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev```
* ```wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu1804.pin```
* ```sudo mv cuda-ubuntu1804.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600```
* ```sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub```
* ```sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/ /"```
* ```sudo apt update``` ```sudo apt install cuda-10-1```
* Reboot the PC
* Check the CUDA version with ```nvcc --version```. In this example V10.1.243 was used.
* ```export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}```
* ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}```
* ```sudo apt install python3-venv git python3.8 python3.8-venv python3.8-dev```
* ```python3.8 -m venv myenv```
* ```source myenv/bin/activate```
* ```sudo apt install python3-pip```
* ```git clone https://github.com/Bismuthfoundation/Bismuth.git``` followed by ```cd Bismuth```
* ```pip3 install wheel```
* ```sudo apt install autoconf libtool libffi-dev```
* ```pip3 install -r requirements-node.txt```
* ```screen -mS node python3 node.py``` You need to wait a while for the Junction Noise file to be created and the ledger bootstrapped and synced. While you wait you can press Ctrl-A d to detach from the screen session, and screen -r node to go back.
* ```cd ~ git``` ```clone https://github.com/Bismuthfoundation/Optipoolware.git```
* ```cd Optipoolware pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
* ```cp optipoolware.py ../Bismuth``` ```cp pool.txt ../Bismuth```
* ```cd ~/Bismuth``` ```screen -mS pool python3 optipoolware.py``` You can press Ctrl-A dto detach from the pool session, and screen -r pool to go back.

### Notes

The pool will use the Bismuth address in the node wallet, found in the file `wallet.der`. If you want to solo mine, you can mine directly to this address by editing the file `miner.txt` and make the miner_address equal to the address in `wallet.der`. In this case, you can also edit min_payout in pool.txt to a large number to prevent payout transactions from the pool.

#### GPU Architecture Configuration:

- If you are using Nvidia `RTX 3060`, `RTX 3070`, `RTX 3080` or `RTX 3090` GPUs, you need to update the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the kbkminer directory before compiling:

```
# Set the architecture of your CUDA card (update to compute capability 8.6)
set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS};-gencode=arch=compute_86,code=sm_86)
```

- The NVIDIA `RTX 4090` is based on the newer Ada Lovelace architecture, which has a different compute capability of 8.9. To optimize CUDA settings for this card, you should update the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS to reflect the compute capability 8.9.

Here's how the setting should look for the `RTX 4090`:
```
# Set the architecture of your CUDA card (compute capability 8.9 for RTX 4090)
set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS};-gencode=arch=compute_89,code=sm_89)
```
#### Pool Configuration:
When running the pool `optipoolware.py`, try adjusting the `mine_diff` setting in `pool.txt` to find the optimal value.

Example value:
```
mine_diff=84
```

#### Successful testing environments:
- Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04
- Nvidia driver version 470, 550
- CUDA version 12.4
- Nvidia cuda toolkit V10.1.243 and V11.5.119
